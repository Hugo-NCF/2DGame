### Echoes of Valkyrie
*A 2DGame mini project in c++*

The Valkyrie, a deep-space vessel, crash-lands on an abandoned planet after a failed jump. The crew discovers the ruins of an advanced civilization, now overrun by infected former inhabitants—victims of a viral outbreak. As the infection spreads among them, the crew fractures. In a desperate bid to survive, they locate an underground facility rumored to hold a cure or escape route. After heavy losses, a few survivors flee the planet in a damaged shuttle. But as they leave, a signal reveals a terrible truth—something infected has followed them.
